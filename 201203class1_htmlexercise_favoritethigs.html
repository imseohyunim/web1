<h2>Earl of Lemongrab</h2>
<p>
  Earl of Lemongrab (or Fat Lemongrab in "Lemonhope Part 2") is a recurring character in Adventure Time. He first appears in the episode "Too Young." He is the high-strung, overly-zealous, obnoxious, paranoid, stubborn ruler of the Earldom of Lemongrab, and the heir to the Candy Kingdom. It is possible that he is no longer heir to the throne because as of "Hot Diggity Doom," the Candy Kingdom is now a democracy. He is the creation of Princess Bubblegum and the first of her experiments to go wrong. He was able to usurp the throne of the Candy Kingdom on the technicality of Bubblegum's de-aging. Once Princess Bubblegum was 18 again, she fires him, and he returns to Lemongrab.

  In "You Made Me," Lemongrab upsets Princess Bubblegum by spying on candy people as they sleep. Princess Bubblegum, Finn, and Jake attempt to stop him by giving him three criminal candy people to govern, the Pup Gang. Lemongrab attempts to adapt to "candy styles" but is unsuccessful, so Finn and Jake are forced to invade Castle Lemongrab. When they fail to rescue the candy people, Princess Bubblegum creates another Lemongrab to live in Castle Lemongrab with the original Lemongrab to keep him company, and upon meeting, the two Lemongrabs decide to release the prisoners. As of "All Your Fault," they had created numerous Lemon Children.

  In "Too Old," it is revealed that the original Earl of Lemongrab has become a bloated tyrant who has put shock collars on all his subjects to force them to do his bidding; moreover, he had eaten over half of his counterpart, Lemongrab 2, and eventually consumes him completely when Lemongrab 2 fights against his oppressive regime.

<p>
  In "Lemonhope Part 2," the Earl, calling himself "Fat Lemongrab," completely converted Castle Lemongrab into a totalitarian city-state, and regularly consumes Lemon People who attempt to flee or oppose them (though they remain alive in his belly, along with Lemongrab 2). Lemonhope defeats "Fat Lemongrab" with his harp playing, which makes "Fat Lemongrab" explode, along with the Lemons in his belly. Princess Bubblegum sews the pieces back into a new Lemongrab, whose parts and personality she says will eventually come together into a single angry, lonely Earl once again.
